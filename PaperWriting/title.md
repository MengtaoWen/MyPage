###  Rules for capitalizing words in document titles
- Always capitalize the first and the last word
- Capitalize all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs and subordinate conjunctions ("as", "because", "although").
- Lowercase all articles, coordinate conjunctions ("and", "or", "nor"), and prepositions regardless of length, when they are other than the first or last word.
- Lowercase the "to" in an infinitive.
